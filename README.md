Data Pre-processing steps and inspiration
Loading the Dataset: The initial step involves loading the dataset into the analysis environment, typically using libraries like Pandas in Python, ensuring accessibility for further examination.
Checking for Data Types: It is imperative to inspect the data types of each column to ensure consistency and appropriateness for subsequent analyses and operations.
Converting Date Column: When dealing with temporal data, such as dates, converting the date column from an object type to a date type facilitates time-based analyses and visualizations.
Handling Outliers: Identification and treatment of outliers are crucial to maintain data integrity. Outliers are assessed visually through plots or statistically using methods like z-scores or IQR (Interquartile Range), ensuring their handling aligns with the context and domain knowledge.
Correlation Analysis: Utilizing tools like heatmaps aids in understanding the interrelationships between various features within the dataset, providing insights into potential dependencies and guiding further exploration.
Exploring Relationships: Beyond correlation analysis, exploring relationships between columns through visualizations and statistical methods unveils additional patterns and dependencies, enriching the understanding of the dataset's dynamics.
Time Series Analysis: Conducting time series analysis involves assessing stationarity through techniques like examining rolling mean and standard deviation, essential for ensuring the reliability of subsequent forecasting models.
Forecasting Models Selection: Employing forecasting model ARIMA entails a methodical approach based on the dataset's characteristics and the desired level of complexity, enabling accurate prediction of future trends.
These pre-processing steps and methodologies lay a solid foundation for rigorous data analysis and forecasting, contributing to informed decision-making and actionable insights.
